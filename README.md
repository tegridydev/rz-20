### RZ-23 Framework: Recursive Zero Knowledge Compression (RZKC)

**Overview:**
The RZ-23 Framework introduces a new system called Recursive Zero Knowledge Compression (RZKC) designed to enhance the efficiency and scalability of blockchain ledgers. RZKC acts as an ephemeral layer that compresses and stores hashes of inscription hashes, batches them together, and inscribes them in bulk. This approach allows for a significant reduction in file size while maintaining the original actionable data, benefiting the entire Bitcoin blockchain.

### Key Components:

1. **Ephemeral Layer:**
   - **Functionality:** Acts as a temporary layer that facilitates the compression and batching process.
   - **Purpose:** To ensure that the compression and batching operations do not permanently alter the blockchain but rather enhance its efficiency.

2. **Hash Compression:**
   - **Process:** Compresses hashes of individual inscriptions.
   - **Benefit:** Reduces the size of data that needs to be stored and transmitted, enhancing overall efficiency.

3. **Batching Mechanism:**
   - **Function:** Collects multiple compressed hashes and batches them together.
   - **Advantage:** Enables bulk inscription, which optimizes storage and processing.

4. **Bulk Inscription:**
   - **Implementation:** Inscribes the batched hashes onto the blockchain in a single transaction.
   - **Outcome:** Significantly reduces the number of transactions and the associated data footprint on the blockchain.

5. **Data Reference Point:**
   - **Role:** The bulk inscriptions act as reference points that can be un-nested to retrieve the original actionable data.
   - **Benefit:** Ensures that the data remains accessible and verifiable while reducing storage requirements.

### Logic Flow:

1. **Inscription Hash Generation:**
   - Each transaction or data piece on the blockchain generates a unique inscription hash.

2. **Recursive Compression:**
   - These inscription hashes undergo a compression process, creating a smaller, compressed hash.

3. **Batch Collection:**
   - Compressed hashes are collected over a defined period or until a certain threshold is reached.

4. **Bulk Inscription:**
   - The collected batch is inscribed onto the blockchain in a single transaction, creating a bulk inscription.

5. **Reference and Retrieval:**
   - The bulk inscription serves as a reference point. When needed, the data can be un-nested to reveal the original inscription hashes and the associated data.
